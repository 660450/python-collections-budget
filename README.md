# Learning Objectives
UsingCounter.py
- Implement a container 
- Infer the number of items in a Sized collection
- Explain the relationship between the built-in function len( and the __len__( method - itâ€™s the same basically, just allows you to pass functions where functions are needed also for readability 'What is magic about __len__()?

UsingSet.py
- Explain the relationship between the in/not in operators and the Container protocol - Use in/ not in
- Implement set operations, including intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference
- Implement sub/superset tests between sets (and other iterable series

- Implement the facilities in the timeit module for measuring the performance of code snippets

CustomClass.py
- Implement an Iterator - For a custom class?
- Implement an iterator signal
- Implement iterator termination based on signal dectection
- Execute the process of supplying an Iterator from an Iterable object - Is just a for loop iterator ok?
- Implement a Sized collection using the __len__( method
